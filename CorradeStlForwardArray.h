    Corrade's forward declaration for std::array
        — a lightweight alternative to the full <array> where supported

    https://doc.magnum.graphics/corrade/StlForwardArray_8h.html

    This is a single-header library generated from the Corrade project. With
    the goal being easy integration, it's deliberately free of all comments
    to keep the file size small. More info, detailed changelogs and docs here:

    v2020.06-1454-gfc3b7 (2023-08-27)
    -   Compatibility with libc++ 16 and newer which has the std::array forward
        declaration in a different header
    -   Compatibility with C++20 which removes the <ciso646> header
    v2019.01-115-ged348b26 (2019-03-27)
    -   Initial release

    Generated from Corrade v2020.06-1454-gfc3b7 (2023-08-27), 88 / 2003 LoC
